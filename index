            <h2 class="do">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. <br><br> <br>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop.</h2>

                    <img class="p1" src="./image/13.png" alt="">
                    <p>Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's the difference, exactly? There isn't anything inherently different about the beans themselves, but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and they're brewed with a higher grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more concentrated liquid with a bolder flavor.</p>

                <h2 class="ho">Flat White</h2>
                <img class="p1" src="./image/2.png" alt="">
                <p>Like the latte, this drink consists of espresso and steamed milk, but the ratio of espresso to milk is higher. Baristas also fold the milk as it steams, which creates a more velvety texture. The flat white has roots in Australia and New Zealand</p>

                <h2 class="ho">Macchiato</h2>
                <img class="p1" src="./image/3.png" alt="">
                <p>A macchiato is a shot of espresso with just a touch of steamed milk or foam. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted," so a caffè macchiato refers to coffee that's been stained with milk.</p>

                    <img class="p1" src="./image/4.png" alt="">
                    <p>This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!</p>

                    <img class="p1" src="./image/5.png" alt="">
                    <p>This espresso-based drink is similar to a latte, but the frothy top layer is thicker. The standard ratio is equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. It's often served in a 6-ounce cup (smaller than a latte cup) and can be topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon.</p>

                    <img class="p1" src="./image/6.png" alt="">
                    <p>This drink, which hails from Spain, is half espresso, half steamed milk. Unlike many Italian coffee drinks, it contains little to no foam. It's typically served in a 4.5-ounce glass.</p>

                        <p>Cutting-edge coffee roasters developed this newer type of cold brew using techniques from the beer industry: It's infused with nitrogen bubbles, so it has a frothy, beer-like texture. Trendy coffee houses dispense nitro cold brew from taps, and you can buy it by the can from brands like RISE Brewing Co. and Starbucks.</p>
